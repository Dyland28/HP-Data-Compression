How to dump a data block:

1) Create a table and insert data
2) Figure out the file numbers and data blocks by running:
SELECT
    dbms_rowid.rowid_relative_fno(rowid) REL_FNO,
    dbms_rowid.rowid_block_number(rowid) BLOCKNO,
    dbms_rowid.rowid_row_number(rowid) ROWNO
FROM capstone.mytable;  <-- tablename

3) Once you see the datafile and block number, run this query:
alter system dump datafile [xx] block [yyyy]; 
where xx = datafile number and yyyy = block number
